# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation Report

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package version 1.5.0
- Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with the resolved dependency tree (376 packages added)

### 2. Code Changes

#### Modified: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after `{children}`
- Preserved all existing code structure, imports, and metadata

## Implementation Details

This is an App Router Next.js project (using the `app` directory structure), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file (`src/app/layout.tsx`). The component is placed after `{children}` inside the `<body>` tag, which is the recommended location for App Router projects.

The Analytics component will now track page views and web vitals automatically across all pages of the application.

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Package installation successful (npm install)
2. ✅ Build completed successfully (`npm run build`)
3. ✅ Linter verified - no new errors introduced in layout.tsx
4. ✅ All changes staged with git, including lock files

## Files Changed
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with dependency resolution
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component

## Notes
- The Analytics component will automatically start collecting data once deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is required for basic analytics functionality
- Pre-existing linting errors in other files (page.tsx) are unrelated to this implementation
