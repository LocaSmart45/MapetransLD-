Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js

## Changes Implemented:

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package (v1.6.1) using npm
- Updated package.json to include the new dependency
- Updated package-lock.json with all transitive dependencies

### 2. Code Integration
Modified: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the {children} element
- Preserved existing code structure and formatting

### 3. Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully (next build)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✅ All pages rendered correctly
- ✅ No new linting errors introduced (pre-existing errors remain)

## Implementation Details:

This project uses the Next.js App Router architecture with TypeScript. The Analytics component was added to the root layout file (src/app/layout.tsx) which applies to all pages in the application.

The Analytics component will automatically track page views and web vitals when the application is deployed to Vercel. No additional configuration is required.

## Files Modified:
- package.json (added @vercel/analytics dependency)
- package-lock.json (updated with new package and dependencies)
- src/app/layout.tsx (added Analytics import and component)

The implementation follows Next.js best practices and the official Vercel Analytics documentation for App Router projects.
